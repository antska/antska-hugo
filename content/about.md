#### The story of my life - TL;DR

> Borned in Athens at 1993 (23 years old). Until the age of 18 I was living in Paros, an island in the center of Cyclades in Greece. At the age of 18, I went back to Athens to study Informatics at the Athens University of Economics and Business([AUEB](http://www.aueb.gr)). As the years went by, I was loving programming more and more by attending my university lessons and completing projects.

> I had found my interest after all. Computers and specifically programming. This is what I wanted to do in my life. The fact that you can create something and then see the result, it's something I love and get passioned about. Simply by giving your brain the satisfaction it requires and the motivation it needs to keep on.

> At the age of 23 and when I had almost finished with my studies, I was interested in writing a diploma thesis. So, together with the professor [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/) and my supervisor [Polykarpos Meladianos](http://www.db-net.aueb.gr/meladianos/) , I created a Chrome extension([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/match-the-news/egccnhfjlnjkmimhnlfmiilhdaajlbpg)) that recommends news regarding the websites you are browsing, called Match The News([website](http://matchthenews.org)). In this project, 2 students from [LiX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) - Ecole Polytechnique contributed as well. 

> At the time the Match The News project was completed, I started working on a project of LiX ([Data Science and Mining team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/)) at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) . The project was to build a solid and scalable database as well as web services for the WID (World Income Database) project of the Paris School of Economics([PSE](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/)). The project lasted 9 months, and it is now running at a Beta stage.

> Now, I am currently working on a project at the Data & Web Mining research group ([DB-net](http://www.db-net.aueb.gr/)) in Athens, Greece. The subject of the project is crawling and archiving of the Greek Internet as part of the long-term web preservation program of the [National Library of Greece](http://www.nlg.gr) .
